# 03: Return a validated proposed change from a private workspace

**What to build:** request a small edit; the worker uses a private project copy and mise toolchain, runs the required checks inside isolation, and returns a proposed change with validation evidence for review.

**Blocked by:** [02: Complete a ChatGPT Pro read-only worker task](02-chatgpt-worker.md)

**Status:** ready-for-agent

**Execution gate:** the user approved this plan and its ticket granularity. Application implementation remains paused until the user asks to begin. A ready status alone does not override that hold or unfinished blocking tickets.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Transfer a named committed base using native Git primitives and private guest metadata; preserve the active checkout and local edits.
- [ ] Correctly collect changed/new/deleted files, binary content, modes, renames and symlinks with path confinement.
- [ ] Dependency access is explicitly allowed; denied destinations do not trigger automatic network expansion.
- [ ] This slice ends at a review-required human gate: it does not call code changes DONE or publish/commit them automatically before the review capability exists.
- [ ] Host collection does not execute guest-provided commands, hooks, filters or configuration.

## Context and constraints

PI Lead is a reusable, per-project Pi package. The user stays in one Lead tab; important workers run their entire Pi process inside Gondolin and appear in named Herdr tabs without taking focus. Herdr is the human control plane, not a sandbox. Prefer native Pi/Herdr/Gondolin/mise/Git mechanisms over new frameworks; a concrete integration failure is a blocker, not permission to weaken the boundary.

The approved targets are macOS arm64 and Ubuntu 24.04 LTS x86_64/arm64. ChatGPT Pro is the initial provider; OpenCode Go was out of quota during planning. Workers use included subscription allowances with no paid fallback. Jev uses OpenRouter with a $1/day ceiling, not a spending target. Real credentials and host control sockets remain outside guests; networking uses explicit allowlists and writable storage/caches are private.

Keep at most two workers active, including reviews, and no more than two review/fix cycles. Automatic validated local commits and task-branch pushes are allowed; PR creation, merges, deployment, privileged operations, protected/force pushes and new destinations are not automatically authorized. Preserve the user's active checkout and uncommitted changes.

DONE requires the scoped outcome, correlated collected artifacts, final-revision validation/review and confirmed cleanup. Failed/BLOCKED workers stop while diagnostic tabs/artifacts remain. Interrupted work requires confirmation before resuming. Successful logs last seven days; failed diagnostics remain until explicitly cleared. This slice may expose an unavailable capability or human gate, but cannot claim unfinished downstream behavior works.

## Validation and delivery

Test public task lifecycle and policy behavior at the approved seams; use controlled runtime substitutes and supplied judgments where appropriate, then real integrations for behavior that substitutes cannot prove. Use a fixture repository with local edits, binary/renamed/deleted files, modes and symlinks. Exercise the edit-to-validation-to-review-required result, denied dependencies and attempts to escape the workspace or execute host hooks/filters.

Run the required checks and an independent Standards/Spec review of this ticket's implementation before committing, even before PI Lead automates review itself. Report commands/results, any review corrections, the delivered revision, runtime evidence and explicit remaining limits. Use Matt implement/TDD; work one behavior at a time. No passing claim for an unrun host/provider/security scenario.

Read source version caveats before using an API; research is source evidence, not runtime acceptance. Bootstrap and consuming-project policy govern actual permissions. Request human-only setup only when it becomes necessary, never by asking for a secret in chat.
