# 15: Execute the dependency frontier with two workers

**What to build:** the Lead takes an approved local ticket graph, runs only unblocked work with at most two workers, integrates verified results and leaves an accurate graph when a task blocks or execution is interrupted.

**Blocked by:** [04: Review, fix and commit a complete local coding task](04-review-fix-commit.md); [06: Recover interrupted work and retain useful diagnostics](06-recovery-retention.md); [12: Turn an idea into approved specs and vertical tickets](12-idea-to-tickets.md)

**Status:** ready-for-agent

**Execution gate:** the user approved this plan and its ticket granularity. Application implementation remains paused until the user asks to begin. A ready status alone does not override that hold or unfinished blocking tickets.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Use atomic claims and fresh ticket contexts; honor genuine blocking edges and prevent duplicate execution.
- [ ] Count reviewer workers within the same limit; queue work without deadlocking a task waiting for review.
- [ ] Serialize integration, detect overlapping changes and invalidate checks when the integrated revision changes; resolve conflicts by documented intent and revalidate.
- [ ] Preserve each worker's tab/result ownership and recover claims without automatically resuming interrupted work.
- [ ] No distributed scheduler or speculative parallelism across unresolved design decisions.

## Context and constraints

PI Lead is a reusable, per-project Pi package. The user stays in one Lead tab; important workers run their entire Pi process inside Gondolin and appear in named Herdr tabs without taking focus. Herdr is the human control plane, not a sandbox. Prefer native Pi/Herdr/Gondolin/mise/Git mechanisms over new frameworks; a concrete integration failure is a blocker, not permission to weaken the boundary.

The approved targets are macOS arm64 and Ubuntu 24.04 LTS x86_64/arm64. ChatGPT Pro is the initial provider; OpenCode Go was out of quota during planning. Workers use included subscription allowances with no paid fallback. Jev uses OpenRouter with a $1/day ceiling, not a spending target. Real credentials and host control sockets remain outside guests; networking uses explicit allowlists and writable storage/caches are private.

Keep at most two workers active, including reviews, and no more than two review/fix cycles. Automatic validated local commits and task-branch pushes are allowed; PR creation, merges, deployment, privileged operations, protected/force pushes and new destinations are not automatically authorized. Preserve the user's active checkout and uncommitted changes.

DONE requires the scoped outcome, correlated collected artifacts, final-revision validation/review and confirmed cleanup. Failed/BLOCKED workers stop while diagnostic tabs/artifacts remain. Interrupted work requires confirmation before resuming. Successful logs last seven days; failed diagnostics remain until explicitly cleared. This slice may expose an unavailable capability or human gate, but cannot claim unfinished downstream behavior works.

## Validation and delivery

Test public task lifecycle and policy behavior at the approved seams; use controlled runtime substitutes and supplied judgments where appropriate, then real integrations for behavior that substitutes cannot prove. Use a graph containing independent, blocked, overlapping and failing tasks. Verify no more than two workers including reviewers, claim persistence, no review deadlock, serialized integration, evidence invalidation, conflict revalidation and interrupted-claim recovery.

Run the required checks and an independent Standards/Spec review of this ticket's implementation before committing, even before PI Lead automates review itself. Report commands/results, any review corrections, the delivered revision, runtime evidence and explicit remaining limits. Use Matt implement/TDD; work one behavior at a time. No passing claim for an unrun host/provider/security scenario.
